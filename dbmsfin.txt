The cost of the monthly subscription is too high for me to be able to afford.
However the content being offered in this specialization is extremely useful.
It provides very specific information that is required to move forward as a software developer and forsee the pitfalls associated with bad database design decisions that may make applications and processes much slower than what they need to be.
In addition I come from a third world country where the monthly cost of the course subscription is very high compared to the average cost of living which with my given employment state makes it even harder for me.


The content being offered in this specialization is extremely useful.
In addition to software engineering being a very lucrative job,
